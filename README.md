# Lua-Scripts
Lua Scripts for Making/Mutating Flame Fractals

Fractal Architect 4 has Lua scripting support.

This repository is intended to hold scripts so that the entire Fractal Architect community can use them. 


### Notes
Some of the scripts here are ported from either Apophysis Pascal scripts or JWildfire Java scripts. 


All of the rest are original scripts.

### How to Use These Scripts

Easiest way is: download the repository as a Zip file.

Fractal Architect's Script selector allows you to open the *My Scripts* folder in the Mac. Then drag scripts from the repository into your active *My Scripts* folder.

OR

You can use the **Choose Folder for My Scripts** button in the app to make the downloaded repository's *My Scripts* folder your active *My Scripts* folder.


### Using DiffMerge to Merge Changes Between Folders

A great tool for moving scripts around is **DiffMerge**.
